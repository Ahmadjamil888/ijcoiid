- [ ] Update `package.json` with necessary dependencies (e.g., @huggingface/hub, transformers.js, python-shell for execution)
- [ ] Add error handling, logging, and scalability improvements
- [ ] Implement user settings for HF token input and storage

## Phase 5: Testing and Refinement
- [ ] Test the full workflow end-to-end
- [ ] Add loading states, progress indicators, and user feedback
- [ ] Ensure production readiness with proper error boundaries and retries
